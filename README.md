# Welcome to my Website!

## Hi, I'm Daniel Brock :v:

I'm currently an MD/PhD student at
[Baylor College of Medicine's Medical Scientist Training Program](https://www.bcm.edu/education/education-programs/md-phd-program).
I have interests in the genetics/epigenetics of blinding diseases :eyes: :dna:

I lose track of time while doing cool research, learning new computer tools, or
watching anime. As you can probably see from the website, I also love being in
nature, whether that's on foot or on a bike :bike:

During December 2022, I learned some HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make this
website. It's purpose is to document my professional career, outreach activities,
and hobbies. Feedback on how to improve this website is much appreciated!

## What I'm working on :test_tube: :stethoscope:

I'm currently in in my first year of graduate school, exploring potential rotation 
labs for my PhD, and learning about web development and machine learning. Feel free 
to reach out to me if you have any questions/feedback :thumbsup:
